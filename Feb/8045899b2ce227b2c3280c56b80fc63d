Privately-owned regional airline Airlink plans to launch a new direct service between Cape Town and Walvis Bay, in Namibia, commencing on March 2. Air Namibia, the country’s national carrier, halted flights on February 11, pending voluntary liquidation, with all aircraft being grounded at base and bookings cancelled indefinitely. The Cape Town – Walvis Bay route will be Airlink’s fourth South Africa – Namibia route, with others including Johannesburg – Windhoek, Cape Town – Windhoek and Johannesburg – Walvis Bay. Airlink CEO Rodger Foster says the new route is ideal for business and leisure travellers with the port city of Walvis Bay being an important economic hub and gateway to some of Namibia’s “prized” tourist destinations, including the Namib Dessert, Swakopmund and the Skeleton Coast. “Walvis Bay, Langstrand and Swakopmund are also home to a significant community of people who commute between Namibia and South Africa.” The route will also enable “seamless multi-city travel” itineraries for international and local tourists visiting popular destinations in Namibia and South Africa, according to Airlink. The airline will operate flights between Cape Town and Walvis Bay on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as well as on Saturdays.
