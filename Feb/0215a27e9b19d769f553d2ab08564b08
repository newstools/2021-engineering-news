Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has reiterated the commitment of the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) to provide water for all. While the sustainable provision of water to everyone is still a challenge facing South Africa and “huge” disparities remain, she said that the comprehensive National Water and Sanitation Master Plan, released in November 2019, was the beginning of ensuring equal and fair provision of water to every citizen of the country. “We regard our Master Plan as a transformation charter for the water and sanitation sector. This is our attempt at addressing the disparities of our past, giving direction to where we are going and ensuring that the disadvantaged are given priority,” Sisulu said during the State of the Nation Address debate at the National Assembly this week. Further, the creation of the National Water Infrastructure Agency, working jointly with municipalities, water boards, financial and mining institutions, and the agricultural community, will sustain and improve the performance of all strategically important water supply systems in regions where water security is at increasing risk. There is also a programme in place to mitigate the delays in issuing water licences, with a commitment to finalise any new and compliant water licence applications between 70 and 90 days, as opposed to the three-year time frame it used to take. Meanwhile, a fully-fledged disciplinary committee is working to investigate and root out any maladministration, fraud and corruption and to also look at audit findings and any other misconduct-related matters. “The department is winning its legal cases one at a time, and has adopted a culture of zero tolerance for corruption.” Turning to the challenges of access to water and sanitation highlighted by the Covid-19 pandemic, a roll-out of emergency water provision, in partnership with water boards and municipalities, had afforded communities in disadvantaged areas access to clean water.
