South African private sector airline Airlink has partnered with major international airlines Lufthansa and SWISS in an interline agreement which is now in force. (SWISS is a member of the Lufthansa Group.) The interline agreement allows passengers to fly between a multitude of destinations on a single ticket, which can be purchased from any of the three airlines or through travel agents. “We are proud and excited about our commercial interline agreement with Lufthansa and SWISS,” stressed Airlink CEO Rodger Foster. “We have a deep respect for these airlines, their values and global reach.” “The Lufthansa Group is pleased to offer our customers even more travel options and convenience through our partnership with Airlink,” affirmed Lufthansa Group Southern and East Africa sales GM Dr André Schulz. “We value Airlink as an important and reliable partner in the restart of our South African operations, and look forward to exploring further opportunities to widen the scope of our joint collaboration.” Airlink serves more than 25 South African domestic destinations and more than 20 regional destinations in Southern Africa. “This partnership represents another milestone in further enhancing our network, and expressing the Lufthansa Group’s commitment to South Africa,” said Schulz. Between them, Lufthansa and SWISS maintain three main hubs in west central Europe, at Frankfurt, Munich and Zurich (other members of the Lufthansa Group, such as Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines, have their own hubs as well). “We are confident that the partnership will provide our respective customers with a wider choice of travel options through the convenient interconnectivity of our respective flights at Johannesburg’s OR Tambo International Airport and Cape Town International Airport,” assured Foster.
