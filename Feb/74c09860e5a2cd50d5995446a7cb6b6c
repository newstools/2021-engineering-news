In keeping with its goal of responsible production and consumption, petrochemicals and chemicals manufacturer Sasol and waste management company GrnCat, have partnered on the recovery of wax from spent catalysts. Since the GrnCat plant was commissioned in 2018, Sasol has recovered and reused more than 6 000 t of clean wax, thereby reducing waste volumes by as much as 50%, claims Sasol. The creation of 30 new jobs associated with the process has also added a social benefit to the environmental and economic advantages. Sasol wax and solvents, energy operations VP Steve Radley says the company is gaining environmental and economic benefits from the reduction in landfill volumes and recovery of saleable product. “We are also supporting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises through established government funding institutions, which aim to promote economic growth and industrial development in the surrounding community.” Founder of GrnCat Dr Jan Reynhardt says since the startup of GrnCat’s wax recovery plant three years ago, it has been constantly optimising its processes. “We have been able to increase our capacity by 60%, to 400 t  a month of clean wax,” he adds. “The collaboration with GrnCat is a pleasing success story for Sasol, GrnCat, the surrounding community and the environment. It also demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement and to making sustainability a reality,” he notes.
