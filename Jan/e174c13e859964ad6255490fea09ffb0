South Africa's state power utility Eskom said on Sunday that a nationwide phased power cut due to end on Sunday would resume from Monday morning because some generating units were not yet operational. "As the return to service of some generation units has been delayed ... Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 5:00 tomorrow morning," Eskom tweeted. It had said on Thursday that the power outages would end on Sunday.
