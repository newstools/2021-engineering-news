Cabinet approved the submission of the Gas Amendment Bill of 2020 to Parliament at its virtual meeting on February 24. A post-Cabinet statement released on Friday said the proposed Bill sought to align the gas industry to, amongst others, new transportation technologies of natural and unconventional gases that were not catered for in the current Gas Act of 2001. “The amendments, which have been fully consulted with all the relevant stakeholders, will contribute to the ongoing investment in infrastructure to ensure diversity of the country’s energy mix.” The Bill would now undergo further Parliamentary consultation processes to ensure it was widely endorsed for implementation once passed into law.
