Telecommunications group MTN has set ambitions of achieving net zero emissions by 2040, setting science-based targets to achieve a 47% average reduction in absolute emissions for scope 1, 2 and 3. MTN said its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets are in line with the information and communication technology (ICT) sectoral target-setting approach recently developed through a collaboration between the Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative, the GSM Association, the International Telecommunication Union and the Science Based Targets Initiative. These targets support the Paris Agreement’s central aim of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change. “As we build and operate the telecommunications infrastructure to drive greater digital and financial inclusion, we believe that our growth and success should not come at the expense of the future of our planet. We must keep addressing the needs and challenges of society, which include playing our part in mitigating the effects of climate change,” said MTN Group president and CEO Ralph Mupita. MTN has launched its Project Zero programme to leverage the latest technologies and service partners to enable business sustainability through greater energy efficiencies, low carbon emissions, risk reduction and cost control. The programme prioritises renewable solutions, efficient emerging technologies and energy storage. “We are pleased that Project Zero is in full swing, actively driving energy efficiency and carbon emission sustainability. We believe ICT companies and mobile operators have the potential to significantly contribute to global decarbonisation efforts,” added MTN Group chief technology and information systems officer Charles Molapisi.
