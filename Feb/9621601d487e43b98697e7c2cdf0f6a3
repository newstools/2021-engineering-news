The Poultry Master Plan, as implemented by the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC), is propelling new entrants and emerging role-players in the industry to build their businesses and expand markets, according to South African Poultry Association broiler organisation GM Isaak Breitenbach. He was one of two panellists presenting during a webinar post the State of the Nation Address (SoNA) on the issue of the DTIC’s Poultry Sector Master Plan on February 26. During the SoNA last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa said that, through the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800-million to upgrade production. “South Africa now produces an additional one-million chickens every week.” Because the poultry industry has low barriers to entry, it is very easy to get into as a younger poultry farmer or emerging small, medium-sized or microenterprise. A webinar attendee also said that new entrants who are broad-based black economic empowerment compliant stand a better chance of reaping associated benefits. The process of compiling the Poultry Master Plan saw cooperation between different Ministers, including Trade, Industry and Competition Minister Ebrahim Patel and Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Thoko Didiza, as well as other departments and constituents, providing the industry with “hope for the future”, said Breitenbach. He emphasised that, for newcomers, a lot more than just having to finance a poultry business was required - potential managers would need to be sourced, marketing ideas drawn up and finances understood.
