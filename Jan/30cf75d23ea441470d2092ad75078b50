Mobile operator Cell C has started migrating its customers onto partner networks. The migration of contract and broadband customers is expected to be completed within the next two months, while the phased transition of prepaid customers will be confirmed in due course. This formed part of Cell C’s three-year network strategy to enable the company to provide network services to customers through roaming agreements with partner networks and undertake a phased decommissioning of its own towers, effectively becoming a wholesale buyer of network capacity and infrastructure services. “In response to a vastly changed business environment, the adoption of the network roaming model will promote more resourceful use of the telecommunications infrastructure capacity in the country, improve the overall network connectivity and provide Cell C customers with a better customer experience,” explained Cell C CEO Douglas Craigie Stevenson. “Our strategic vision is to differentiate ourselves by focusing on innovative products and services without being owners of capital-intensive infrastructure.” Contract and broadband customers are requested to activate the data roaming setting manually on their phones, or through a computer if using a router, to minimise service and connectivity disruptions. The data roaming of Apple device users will be activated automatically.
