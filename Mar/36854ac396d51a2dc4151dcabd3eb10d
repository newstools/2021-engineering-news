Trade union Solidarity has obtained a warrant of execution to seize R12.7-million worth of assets from State-owned defence group Denel. The union explained in a statement on March 4 that this followed after the entity failed to meet various contractual and statutory obligations towards its employees. “This is a huge victory for our members who had to endure a time of unprecedented uncertainty and tension. “At least it gives our members a bit of a breather and they can sigh a sigh of relief in the knowledge that their overdue salaries would be partially covered in this way,” said Solidarity deputy general secretary Helgard Cronjé. Cronjé said employees have had to bear the consequences of mismanagement far too often. “With this we are also conveying a message that employees in the public sector are tired of constantly having to bear the brunt of corruption and ignorance at or in their businesses. “It is time for the State to realise that if it cannot make a positive contribution to these businesses then it must at least stop being such a major burden, prejudicing their proper running,” he said.
