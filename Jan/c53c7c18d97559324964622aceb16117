Engineering company Siemens Gamesa will deliver 29 SG 3.4-132 wind turbines to State-owned utility Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) for the Assela project − a 100 MW wind farm that will help power over 400 000 Ethiopian households. The wind farm is set to be commissioned by spring 2023 and is slated to save more than 260 000 t of carbon dioxide a year of emissions. The Assela Wind Farm will be located between the towns of Adama and Assela, about 150 km south of the capital Addis Ababa and will contribute to clean and affordable power for the country’s electricity grid. The country has set an ambitious target to supply 100% of its domestic energy demand through renewable energy by 2030. According to the African Development Bank, Ethiopia has abundant renewable energy resources, particularly wind, with a potential 10 GW of installation capacity. The country has installed capacity of 324 MW of wind at present. “Siemens Gamesa is intent on expanding its leadership across Africa and, in turn, helping a growing transition to green energy across the continent. "So, we are extremely pleased to begin work in Ethiopia and look forward to collaborating with both EEP and the country to continue to promote their drive to install more renewables and meet transformational energy targets,” says Siemens Gamesa Onshore Southern Europe and Africa CEO Roberto Sabalza.
