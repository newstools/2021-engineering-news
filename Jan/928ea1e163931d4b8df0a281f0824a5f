From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Rosond has delivered a range of newly manufactured, technologically advanced drill rigs to Kumba Iron Ore’s Kolomelo and Sishen mines, to be fully operationalised early this year. Natasha Odendaal tells us more. Natasha Odendaal: In an anticipated move that will not only boost women participation in the mining sector but unlock machine learning and data analysis that could further enhance productivity and efficiencies, a range of newly manufactured automated rigs have made their way to the Northern Cape. The final batch of 28 newly manufactured advanced drilling rigs under a R2-billion multiyear contract with mining services group Rosond has been delivered to Anglo American-controlled Kumba Iron Ore in the Northern Cape, with expectations that the new range will be fully operational early in 2021. Rosond MD Ricardo Ribeiro: Natasha Odendaal: The drills offer heightened safety, owing to less manual intervention during operations, and operators are housed in a climate-controlled, airconditioned control room. They have also been developed to transform the way drilling is done, bringing together automation, software and data analysis technology to create a new-age drilling rig as Rosond starts transitioning into a drilling technology company.
