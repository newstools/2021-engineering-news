The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) is investing an estimated R500-million in a road infrastructure project in the Buffalo City metropolitan municipality, in the Eastern Cape. The contract will involve the improvement of the N2 national road from Green River to Buffalo River Bridge. The project’s main contractor is WBHO, with Mariswe the supervision engineering firm and Gibb the design engineering firm. Eastern Cape Roads, Transport and Safety MEC Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe has told community members to “jealously guard” the project and ensure that there are no delays as a result of community feuds. “Our plea to you as the government of the Eastern Cape is for you to look after this project and ensure that there are no delays caused by unnatural causes. “This project is not only going to create job opportunities, but it’s set to improve the quality of life of locals when completed, for generations to come,” says Tikana-Gxothiwe. “The fruits of this major investments will be life changing and of great benefit to these communities, for generations.” The project is currently in the mobilisation phase, and construction is expected to start in the middle of April and last for 33 months. The project is for the improvement of sections 14 and 15 on the N2 and entails road widening and reconstruction to improve the level of service to road users; geometric improvements to improve the road alignment; geometric safety improvements at intersections; construction of a new bridge over the Tshoxa river and adjacent railway line; construction of a second new bridge over the Tshoxa river (next to Engen); and construction of a new bridge over the Buffalo river, in King Williams Town. “Buffalo City metropolitan municipality communities are expected to play a vital role in this project as a source of skills and labour,” says Sanral Southern region manager Mbulelo Peterson. The project liaison committee has already been established and inducted.
