Development finance institution the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) on February 16 announced the 36-month debarment of civil engineering company Global Interjapan (Kenya), with effect from August 24, 2020, which renders Global Interjapan (Kenya) and its affiliates ineligible to participate in AfDB group-financed projects during the period. An investigation conducted by the AfDB Group's Office of Integrity and Anti-Corruption established that the Nairobi-based civil engineering firm had engaged in fraudulent practices during a tender for the AfDB-financed Small Scale Irrigation and Value Addition Project in Kenya. Additionally, the debarment qualifies for cross-debarment by other multilateral development banks, including the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank Group, under the Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment Decisions. After the debarment period, Global Interjapan (Kenya) will only be eligible to participate in AfDB group-financed projects on condition that it implements an integrity compliance programme consistent with the AfDB's guidelines. The Small Scale Irrigation and Value Addition Project aimed at reducing poverty by enhancing agricultural productivity, income and food security among the residents of eleven counties in Kenya, and was co-financed by the AfDB.
