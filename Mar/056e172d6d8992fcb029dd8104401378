MTN Nigeria is at an advanced stage in renewing its operating spectrum and licence in Nigeria for another ten years from September, the local unit of South Africa's MTN said on Sunday. The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has approved the renewal of the 900 MHz and 1 800 MHz bands due to expire in August 2021. The spectrum underpins MTN's data network and telecom coverage in Africa's biggest economy, the group said in its annual report published on Sunday. MTN said 37.2-million subscribers, or 48.7% of its Nigerian subscriber base, have submitted national identification numbers as part of a government requirement to tighten SIM registration.
