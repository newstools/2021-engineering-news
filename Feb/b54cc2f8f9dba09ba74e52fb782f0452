South African private-sector regional airline Airlink has announced that it has had to further suspend its route between Johannesburg in South Africa and Nosy Be in Madagascar. The new suspension will be in force until June 27 this year. Nosy Be is a destination which has been growing in popularity with South African tourists. It can still provide a ‘non-commercialised’ beach and adventure holiday experience, including excellent scuba-diving, snorkeling, sports fishing and kayaking, as well as unique flora and fauna. “We regret the impact this will have for those customers already holding confirmed bookings for the April Easter holidays,” said Airlink MD and CEO Rodger Foster. “Unfortunately despite multiple efforts from the lodges on Nosy Be, the Nosy Be Tourism Authority and Ravinala Airports, we have to date been unable to obtain certainty as to when Madagascar intends to reopen its borders for regional travel.” “(T)his leaves us with no option but to cancel our planned flights on the route in the interim. Customers holding tickets will be able to rebook on a future flight at no additional cost,” he stated. “From the multiple engagements we have had with the Malagasy authorities, we are hopeful that the borders will re-open in time for Airlink to resume services for the June/July peak South African holiday season, followed by the August-October period which coincides with the return of the whale sharks to the island which is an exciting feature of any visit to the island.”
