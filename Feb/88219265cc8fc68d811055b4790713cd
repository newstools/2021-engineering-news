Comair, the South African private sector airline group which operates the British Airways in Southern Africa and Kulula low cost carrier brands, has announced that Kulula will resume operations at Lanseria International Airport on April 1. These flights will service the carrier’s routes to Cape Town and Durban. Initially, both routes will be operated with a limited schedule. The number of flights will, however, be increased over the coming months. Passengers can now book flights from and to Lanseria. “We are upbeat and extremely excited about the reopening of our services back at Lanseria, as part of our ramp-up strategy,” said Kulula executive head of revenue management Desmond O’Connor. “At (Kulula) we aim to make travel as simple, easy and convenient as possible and we look forward to welcoming back all our customers onboard our flights, especially those from the north-western parts of Johannesburg and Pretoria.” Comair spent much of last year in voluntary business rescue, largely caused by the total halt on commercial flights in the country caused by the national lockdown imposed by the government, in an attempt to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Kulula restarted operations at the beginning of December. “With the reintroduction of flights between Lanseria, Durban and Cape Town and with the faster check-in processes, as well as a shorter walk from the car park to the terminal, (Lanseria is) an obvious choice for visitors that frequently fly into Gauteng,” he pointed out. Comair restarted its operations with a combined fleet of 15 aircraft for both brands. Prior to entering business rescue, it had operated 26 aircraft, all of them versions of the Boeing 737 single-aisle airliner. As operations increase, the number of aircraft in operation will also increase.
