About 236 students will benefit from bursaries to be awarded by MultiChoice South Africa (SA), worth R26-million, in 2021. The bursaries will be provided to students in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, broadcasting, media, film and television, human resources, finance, economics, law, communications, UI/UX/CX design, consumer insights and advertising. “We believe investing in these fields of study is critical for the future of our industry and our country,” says MultiChoice SA CEO Nyiko Shiburi. While the MultiChoice bursaries programme has been a long-standing part of the company’s upliftment initiatives, its 2021 bursaries are of particular importance to the company. “Many families and households are struggling to make ends meet after either the loss of employment or, in many cases, the tragic loss of loved ones and breadwinners to Covid-19. Our 2021 bursary programme is one of our initiatives that seek to soften this blow,” Shiburi adds in the statement on January 20. The MultiChoice bursaries programme enables students to focus on their studies without the financial stress that often plagues students and negatively affects their chances of success. The bursaries go beyond tuition fees to cover registration fees, accommodation, and a living allowance for the year. Applicants must be South African and registered at a recognised South African institution of higher learning for an undergraduate or post-graduate degree up to the master’s level. Applicants must also meet the academic performance requirements of a 65% or higher aggregate mark in their previous year of study. The bursaries will be awarded for the 2021 academic year only, and have the potential to be renewed, based on the availability of funds and the student’s academic performance. Applications close on January 31.
