Black-owned private equity management company Khulisa Investment Partners is providing funding to businesses typically under-served by financial institutions, and facilitating a transfer of wisdom to the next generation of business leaders in South Africa. It notes in a statement that, by nurturing and mentoring young management, its purpose is to build substantial and economically powerful businesses to help drive the South African economy of the future. Khulisa will raise investment funds from impact-driven investors and will harness the collective wisdom of successful South African businesspersons willing to contribute their time, energy and experience to make sound investment decisions into selected small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It has developed processes which use the decision-making skills of seasoned business professionals to select tomorrow’s businesses for investment. It will harness this network of individuals to deliver ongoing mentorship programmes for up-and-coming business leaders. Khulisa says this will ensure skills are transferred substantively to the next generation of business professionals, while also adding maximum value to its investments. Khulisa’s various funds will raise about R750-million from institutional funders to invest in SMEs operating in sectors such as engineering, manufacturing, healthcare and financial technology. The company is particularly focused on businesses that can catalyse job creation and the transformation of the workplace.
