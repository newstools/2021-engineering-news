While consumption habits of people and the resulting patterns have changed and are now leaning more towards digital consumption, commercial gaming company Polycade co-founder and CEO Tyler Bushnell says the gaming industry has experienced “exceptional growth”. The industry was valued at about $179-billion at the end of 2020, up from 2019’s $160-billion. Bushnell explains that the pandemic has accelerated the industry’s popularity, even going as far as encouraging older players to return to gaming or enticing new players to join the gaming community. E-sports is a good indicator for this, he adds, noting that this segment had seen rapid growth even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Polycade entered a partnership in 2020 with Liquid Media Group to bring the Canadian entertainment company’s retro gaming titles into the recently launched Polycade Game Store. Liquid’s retro games will also be available via Polycade’s commercial models. The Polycade Game Store, which works on Windows-based computers, will soon be Web-based, bringing all devices into play. “Our focus is on providing users with a very easy-to-access and uncomplicated gaming experience that can really be enjoyed by the whole family together,” Bushnell comments. International distribution of the platform started in January this year.
