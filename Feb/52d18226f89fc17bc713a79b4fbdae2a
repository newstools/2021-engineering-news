Technology solutions provider Abengoa Innovations has completed the construction of the demonstration plant for the Grasshopper project. The project is aimed at generating sustainable power using hydrogen fuel cells. As part of this project, a pilot plant has been built in Seville and moved to Abengoa’s testing facilities in the Port of Seville in Spain, where it is being commissioned and started up. Following this, it will be transported to Delfzijl, in the Netherlands, where it will use the hydrogen excess produced in the Nouryon chlor-alkali plant, thus validating power production in a real industrial environment. The Grasshopper project involves the creation a next-generation fuel cell power plant, capable of generating emission-free electricity and heat from hydrogen. The completion of the construction of the Grasshopper project represents a key milestone for Abengoa Innovation, as it opens the door to new developments in this field, the company states. In addition to Abengoa, the project consortium includes INEA-Informatizacija Energetika Avtomatizacija, Johnson Matthey Fuel Cells, Nedstack Fuel Cell Technology, Politécnico di Milano and Zentrum für Brennstoffzellen Technik. This project has received funding from the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking. This joint undertaking receives support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, Hydrogen Europe and Hydrogen Europe Research.
