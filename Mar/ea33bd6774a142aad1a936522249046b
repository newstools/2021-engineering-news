Food service brands Marvello and Meadowland, owned by Siqalo Foods, have partnered with consumer goods company RCL Foods' Your Food Partners and food service firm Bidfood to provide a R2-million-a-year stimulus package for black-owned hospitality businesses, including restaurants, catering companies and accommodation businesses. The stimulus package caters for training, business coaching and access to capital. The Sekela Hospitality Support Programme is a holistic, phased programme for which businesses can apply until the end of April. The programme recruitment drive started on March 1. The first phase will allow up to 50 successful applicants to join the programme and receive a 10% purchase discount on any food order placed through Bidfood. In phase two, qualifying beneficiaries will receive relevant top-class back-of-house training and business coaching, followed by essential financial assistance or support planning and business profiling. “We look forward to engaging with motivated applicants who are eager to turn their establishments into professionally-run and financially viable businesses. With this programme, we aim to bring much-needed life, passion and positivity back into the hospitality industry and help shape dynamic business leaders,” says Marvello and Meadowland brand manager Perpetua Ngulube. Siqalo Foods urges business owners to use this opportunity to sustain their businesses. “The industry has had to endure the Covid-19 pandemic with the international travel ban, curfew, recurring alcohol bans, maximum capacity and social distancing restrictions all coming into play. Our solution can help drive a positive change and enable business owners and entrepreneurs to achieve their potential,” says RCL Foods Your Food Partners channel marketing executive Edwin Ukama.
