Information and communication technology (ICT) market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) says there are positive opportunities in Ethiopia as the government focuses on liberalising the telecommunications sector and allowing for foreign investment. This move creates space for organisations and investors to explore opportunities in this changing ICT ecosystem, which will have long-term benefits for the country, the IDC says in its ‘Ethiopia ICT Landscape and Future Market Opportunities’ market perspective insight analysis. The analysis looks at the market opportunities that are likely to emerge in the broader ICT sector as a result of the Ethiopian government's stated intentions to open up the telecommunications sector and allow foreign investment. It examines the current state of play and looks at possible opportunities in the broader ICT ecosystem, as well as highlighting key issues about which investors need to be aware. One of the key takeaways highlighted in the report is the conflicting information around the state and the level of liberalisation that is planned, says IDC East Africa regional consulting and research manager Francis Hook. "As one of the last countries on the continent to allow for the liberalisation of the telecoms market, Ethiopia will likely take a different path to its neighbours. "The ongoing liberalisation of the telecommunications sector is expected to usher in a new era for the rapidly evolving and mature ICT market, with new opportunities — via partnerships with existing and new local players — in the consumer and enterprise spaces," says Hook.
