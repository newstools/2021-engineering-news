Trade, Industry and Competition Deputy Minister Fikile Majola says the concession agreement awarded to MTP Aviation Solutions by the Lesedi local municipality must benefit a significant percentage of communities that reside in and around the facility as well. The Lesedi municipality awarded a 60-year concession to MTP Aviation Solutions for the design, development, operation and management of the Heidelberg Aerodrome, which will be developed in accordance with an approved master plan with a strong emphasis on air cargo. The benefits of the initial estimated construction cost of R7.8-billion must also reach and empower the community of Lesedi, Majola asserts. He emphasises that it should become common practice to involve communities in investment projects that will have an impact on their livelihoods. The aerodrome development is included in a proposed special economic zone (SEZ) to be established for the Sedibeng region and which will include trade zones, an agri-zone, an airport city and an aviation platform. “It is expected that the development will serve as a catalyst for the development of the regional economy of Sedibeng region and Lesedi local municipality with major contribution to job creation in the region,” indicates Majola. Lesedi executive mayor Lerato Maloka notes that this economic injection will benefit the community of Leseding. “We are really looking forward to economic opportunities and skills transfer opportunities that will be the result of this project. “This is certainly one of the biggest investment projects in our municipality, more especially during these turbulent economic times that have been exacerbated by the Covid pandemic. This investment provides an opportunity to take this municipality and its residents forward,” she says.
