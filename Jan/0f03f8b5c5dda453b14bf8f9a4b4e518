Europe-based global major aerospace group Airbus has reported that its total commercial aircraft deliveries last year were 34% lower than in 2019. However, this significantly reduced number was in line with the manufacturer's adaptation plan, announced in April, to cope with the effects of the global Covid-19 pandemic. In all, Airbus delivered 566 commercial aircraft to 87 customers last year. These deliveries comprised 38 A220 family airliners (in comparison to 48 in 2019), 446 A320 family (2019 deliveries were 642), 19 A330 family (2019: 53), 59 A350 family (2019: 112) and four A380s (2019: eight). Of the 2020 deliveries of A320 family aircraft, 431 were new engine option (neo) versions (as against 551 A320neos delivered in 2019). Of the A330s delivered last year, 13 were A330neos (in comparison to 41 A330neos delivered in 2019). And 2020 deliveries of A350 family airliners included 14 A350-1000s, while 25 A350-1000s had been delivered in 2019. "Working hand-in-hand with our customers allowed us to navigate a difficult year," stressed Airbus CEOÂ Guillaume Faury. "The Airbus teams, customers and suppliers truly pulled together in the face of adversity to deliver this result. We also thank our partners and governments for their strong support to the sector. Based on our 2020 deliveries we are cautiously optimistic as we look into 2021, although challenges and uncertainties remain high in the short term." Regarding new airliner orders, 2020 saw the group book a gross total of 383. However, order cancellations during the year meant that the company ended the year with a net total of 268 new orders. The new orders were composed of 64 A220s, 296 A320s, two A330s and 21 A350s. Of the orders for A320 family airliners, 37 were for the A321XLR, the longest-ranged single-aisle airliner on the market, with a range of up to 8 700 km. On the debit side, total order cancellations amounted to 115. Taking these cancellations into account, at the end of 2020 Airbus' total order backlog stood at 7 184 aircraft.
