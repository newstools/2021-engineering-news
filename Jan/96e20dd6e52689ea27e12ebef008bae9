The Aerospace and Defence Trade Show (ADTS) 2021, scheduled for late March at Lanseria International Airport, has been cancelled. This is consequence of the great uncertainties presented by the continuing Covid-19 pandemic, with South Africa now experiencing its second wave of the disease. “The decision to cancel was not an easy one, however the health and safety of all concerned, together with adhering to the prescripts of the law, is of absolute importance to us,” explained South African Aerospace, Maritime and Defence Industries Association acting executive director and ADTS 2021 executive committee chairperson Sandile Ndlovu. “We’ve looked at all the possible scenarios and really want to thank all exhibitors and sponsors for their patience and unwavering support in the past months leading to this difficult yet essential decision.” The pandemic continues to have a severe impact on events worldwide. Although South Africa is still open to international air passenger traffic, the number of international flights to and from the country declined after the government returned the country to a Level 3 lockdown. “Trade events traditionally rely on the patronage of international delegations, and this is a return on investment that we would offer to our exhibitors; failing to present our exhibitors with high-level delegations and buyers would not augur well for us as organisers,” he pointed out. “This was also a factor taken into account in the decision-making process.” “Our focus now is directed at AAD [Africa Aerospace and Defence] 2022, which is scheduled to take place from 21 to 25 September,” he affirmed. “We will continue to work hard at creating platforms for the South African defence and aerospace industry that will bring value to their business initiatives and grow their international footprints, and so look forward to welcoming all our valued stakeholders to AAD 2022.”
