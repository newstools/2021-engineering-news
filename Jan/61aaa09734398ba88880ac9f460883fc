Johannesburg-based think-tank Brenthurst Foundation director Dr Greg Mills has welcomed the appointment of Dr Emmanuel Owusu-Sekyere and Professor Lyal White to the Foundation, saying their appointments will bolster the Foundation’s growing research workload across Africa. The Brenthurst Foundation, focused on economic development on the African continent, appointed Owusu-Sekyere as deputy research director and White as research associate. Mills said Owusu-Sekyere and White’s experience and expertise bolster the think-tank’s research capacity. “The world and the way we do business has been transformed in the last year and the challenge for our continent is to now turn this crisis into an opportunity. Our mission is to work with governments across Africa to make sure this happens,” says Mills. Owusu-Sekyere's experience includes at the Human Sciences Research Council, where he manages a team of experts in sustainable development research, project implementation, monitoring and evaluation, including economic security, migration and development, and youth development in Africa. White has significant experience in ‘on-the-ground’ research and advisory in new markets such as Africa and Latin America. He was previously founding director of the Johannesburg Business School at the University of Johannesburg, which had a strong focus on growing and scaling new African businesses. Brenthurst Foundation founder Jonathan Oppenheimer said White and Owusu-Sekyere’s appointments reinforce the think-tank’s commitment, expertise and presence across the African continent.
