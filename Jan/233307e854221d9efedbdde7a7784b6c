DHL Global Forwarding is investing R127-million in a new facility in Johannesburg. Aimed at cementing its position in South Africa, the new 13 000 m2 facility will be located within the bonded zone at Skyparks Business Estate, next to the OR Tambo International Airport. “While it’s too early to fully grasp the economic impact of the current [Covid-19] pandemic, our confidence in investing ahead of the curve is abetted by our diverse service portfolio and long-established foothold in Africa,” says DHL Global Forwarding South Africa MD Clement Blanc. “As the world’s largest free-trade area [Africa] moves toward economic integration, our five-year strategy to sharpen our core business offerings and accelerate digitalisation will further our growth in the region and, specifically, in South Africa.” Twice the size of its current set-up, this new facility will consist of a 10 000 m2 warehouse that enables DHL Global Forwarding to consolidate all its customers’ warehousing requirements. There will be an exclusive and specialised cold chain facility that consists of three adjustable temperature controlled refrigerators geared to handle life science and healthcare products in and out of South Africa. The warehouse will also support other value-added services including cross-docking, storage for air, ocean and road freight services, and a platform for breakbulk cargo.  

“Custom-built to our world-class specifications and located in proximity to the airport, arterial thoroughfares and upcoming industrial parks, this new facility will be the game-changer for DHL in the country,” says Blanc. “We are well-poised to focus on delivering excellence to our customers as we surround ourselves with the critical infrastructure that is needed to enhance our productivity and efficiency.” The African Continental Free Trade Area started trade on January 1.
