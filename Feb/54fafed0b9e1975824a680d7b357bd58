Mahindra South Africa (MSA) says the multiyear agreement between itself and the SsangYong Motor Company (SYMC) has ended, which means that MSA will no longer act as the local distributor for SYMC, as from February 28. This marks the end of a multiyear agreement, during which MSA took over full responsibility for the SsangYong brand and its vehicles in South Africa. For the last four years, since SsangYongâ€™s withdrawal from South Africa, MSA says it has maintained a comprehensive parts catalogue in South Africa and honoured all customer obligations. MSA says it will continue to honour any remaining SsangYong vehicle warranties and service plans, provided they fall within the contractual parameters. At the same time, it will make any remaining parts and components available to any servicing dealer, without carrying any legal responsibility on behalf of the Korean brand.
