Telecommunications giant MTN is offering customers 1 GB of free data for an hour to incentivise the download and zero-rated use of the Covid-19 Alert application. The Covid Alert SA app, designed by Discovery for the Department of Health, uses Bluetooth contact tracing technology, anonymously and privately, to inform people of exposure to someone who has tested positive for Covid-19. “One of the critical aspects of combatting Covid-19 is the ability to detect positive cases early and to isolate as many contacts as possible. The Covid Alert app gives every smartphone user in South Africa the chance to understand their exposure to the virus, so that we can all protect our families and our communities, and especially those people who are most at risk of severe disease,” said MTN South Africa executive for corporate affairs Jacqui O’Sullivan. However, at least 10% to 15% of the population in a given area needs to download and use app in order for Bluetooth contact tracing to be effective. “At 60% uptake, suppression of the virus can be achieved. This is why we have taken the steps to zero rate and even reward our customers who have downloaded the app,” she continued.
