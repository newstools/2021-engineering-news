South Africa will receive 1-million doses of the SII/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in January, with a further 500 000 doses expected in February. This was according to Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, who announced on Thursday that the Department of Health had secured doses from the Serum Institute of India (SII). On Sunday, Mkhize had briefed the nation on non-disclosure agreements for the roll out of the Covid-19 vaccine. “Today, I am pleased to announce that the Serum Institute of India has given us permission to make a public announcement and start engaging with all relevant stakeholders in preparation for the roll out,” he said. The SII/AstraZeneca vaccine is approved by various regulators and is being rolled out in other countries. The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority has begun regulation processes for the roll out. Health workers will be first in line to receive the long-awaited vaccine, with further doses being rolled out in phases. Mkhize explained that government directly undertook negotiations and managed payment with the manufacturer, which he says strengthens the credibility of the process. The health minister called for patience and urged South Africans, members of the public, political parties, business, labour, nongovernmental organisations and community leaders and members to work with the department as the roll out begins. Government hopes to vaccinate 40-million South Africans by the end of the year.
