The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) has launched its highly anticipated E-Compliance Certificate online system as part of embracing technology to enable employers, small businesses and entrepreneurs to apply for a UIF compliance certificate (tender letter) without leaving the comfort of their homes or having to queue for manual issuance.

According to a statement released by the Department of Employment and Labour, the new and innovative system replaces the old application process of manually completing and submitting a form, sworn statement and South African Revenue Service tax clearance certificate by email.

UIF head of corporate services Advocate Mzie Yawa encouraged UIF clients to visit the department's website and click on the UIF e-Compliance Certificate tab under the Online Systems tab to register and apply.

Yawa urged small businesses, companies and entrepreneurs to register on the system using their UIF reference number and apply for the UIF compliance certificate. “If you are up to date with your UIF compliance requirements, the system will issue you with a compliance certificate immediately, which you can download or print. If you are not compliant, the system will issue a non-compliance letter with reasons for the rejection,” explained Yawa.
