Government has conveyed its sadness at the death of Peotona Group Holdings co-founder and executive director Dolly Mokgatle. She was an established business leader who held various leadership positions within several of South Africa’s State-owned enterprises and the private sector. Mokgatle was well-known for her notable contributions towards the empowerment of women. “This is truly a sad day, as we have lost a leader who recognised the critical importance of gender equity and the empowerment of women. She was a staunch believer in educating and mentoring girls to achieve their dreams,” comments Government Communication and Information System director-general Phumla Williams. Mokgatle also served as Spoornet CEO, and was the first black non-technical woman to be appointed to the position of Eskom Transmission MD. Her wealth of experience in energy-related matters also played a role in her appointment as National Energy Regulator of South Africa deputy chairperson of the board. “Today, as a country, we have lost a great leader, a visionary and someone who was instrumental in steering energy-related matters for the country. We must all continue with her legacy and work to empower women,” adds Williams.
