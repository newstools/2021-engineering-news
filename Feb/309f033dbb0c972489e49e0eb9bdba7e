Industry body the Africa Solar Industry Association (Afsia) has published its first yearly 'Africa Solar Outlook' report, which provides clear and concise information about the solar dynamics in each country in Africa to help solar professionals make decisions, says Afsia CEO John van Zuylen. The report reviews the key drivers for successful solar developments in each country and provides snapshots of their statuses and latest developments. "We focused on the most notable and trending aspects of each segment. On top of the country vignettes, the report goes deeper into some of the main segments that comprise the solar industry, including large-scale projects, commercial and industrial, mini-grids, solar-powered fuel stations and solar home systems." The solar industry in Africa is booming owing to new and more flexible technologies being brought to market, as well as the significant cost reductions for solar panels and storage solutions. These new and improved technologies make it possible to use electricity reliably and affordably where it previously was not possible, and solar promises a significant improvement in locations where the grid is present but is erratic or too expensive, says Van Zuylen. â€œWe are entering a decade of wonderful prospects for solar in Africa, a decade in which solar professionals are in a position to achieve universal electrification targets across the continent, thereby impacting the living conditions of 600-million people and boosting the continental economy by providing better and cheaper electricity to the companies and industries," he concludes. Afsia is headquartered in Kigali, Rwanda, and the report can be downloaded for free from its website.
