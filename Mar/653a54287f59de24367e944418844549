The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) has announced a change in its naming conventions, as it says it represents a wider community of stakeholders than only vehicle manufacturers. “Traditionally, we were established to primarily represent the interests of local vehicle manufacturers,” says CEO Mikel Mabasa. “Our mandate has since evolved to include not only manufacturing original equipment manufacturers (OEMs, or vehicle manufacturers), but also retail OEMs and heavy commercial OEMs in South Africa. “We proudly have an extended mandate and our mission is to actively and responsibly promote, represent, advance and protect all our members’ collective and non-competitive interests across the automotive value chain. “Our strategic evolution is very important to our work and to the growth and development of our sector, adds Mabasa. “We are convinced that the automotive industry is going to change faster in the next ten years than it has in the last hundred years. “Since the beginning of this year, we’ve invited other like-minded companies who have interests in the automotive industry to join Naamsa as associate members so that they can directly influence the transformative direction we have set for ourselves. “It is for this reason that Naamsa, from today forward, will be referred to as Naamsa | the Automotive Business Council, and no longer the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa.”
