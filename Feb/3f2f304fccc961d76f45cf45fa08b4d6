State-owned power utility Namibian Power Corporation (NamPower) has launched a request for information to developers or technology providers for the proposed development of the 50 MW Luderitz wind power project. This exercise is aimed at soliciting market information from interested parties, including developers; financiers; engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors; lenders; operations and maintenance contractors; regulators; and consumers to assist in developing decisions that will shape and influence the development of the proposed project. The proposed project site is located 9 km from the seashore and 20 km south of Luderitz and has a mean wind speed of 9.21 m/s at 100 m above ground level and estimated capacity factors of about 50%. To participate, interested parties can visit www.nampower.com.na for information on the proposed project and email submissions to windmarketsounding@nampower.com.na before March 8. The corporation points out that this is not the beginning of a bidding process, nor a prequalification exercise. The utility hopes to award an EPC contract by March 2022.
