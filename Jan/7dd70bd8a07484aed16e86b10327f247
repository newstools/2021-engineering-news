Liquor associations the National Liquor Traders Council and the Liquor Traders Association of South Africa have written a letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa with regard to the continued ban on alcohol sales and have also requested a meeting to discuss the matter. The letters notes that the coalition of liquor traders employs over 282 000 workers and operates a combined 39 900 liquor outlets. It posits that its businesses are in the main black owned and contribute to local job creation and township economies and the country. Moreover, it highlights the industry's contribution to the country’s tax revenue, as well as the role it plays in the value-added chain. It mentions concerns over the ban, including the impact thereof on the job security of employees and the economic impact on their families, and has therefore made several requests. Firstly, it says the off-site consumption liquor sector could be restored to normal pre-lockdown trading hours, while continuing to adhere to safety health protocols and physical distancing measures. Moreover, it requests ongoing Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer/Employees Relief Scheme support while the ban is in place. It also calls for rental relief and compensation for stock that expires. Lastly, it has requested a tavern financial relief package of R20 000 for taverns and shebeen permit holders in light of the ban.
