The Water Research Commission (WRC) and the Technology Innovation Agency (TIA) are calling on interested stakeholders to apply for the Water Seed Fund programme. Higher education institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises in the water sector have until January 29 to submit an expression of interest to be considered for funding to support their projects. The Water Seed Fund will award up to R200 000 a project for innovation-oriented projects, with the aim of supporting commercialisation of water-related intellectual property generated from South African research and development aligned to addressing South Africa’s water challenges. The objective of the WRC TIA Water Seed Fund is to support pre-seed and seed activities with the intention to develop innovations into next stage investor fundable opportunities. A steering committee, comprising representatives from the WRC, TIA and industry stakeholders, will review new proposals for funding in line with the call and formally assess progress on selected projects on a quarterly basis.
