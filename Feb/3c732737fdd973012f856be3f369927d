Renewable energy leasing solutions company Solarise Africa has announced its expansion into Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia after signing a partnership agreement with turnkey energy services company Centennial Generating . The partnership adds seven projects in Rwanda, spread across the education, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, hospitality and agriculture sectors; two projects in Zambia; and one upcoming project in Uganda to the Solarise Africa portfolio. This comes after Solarise Africa last year raised $10-million in its Series B funding round to bolster its focus on expansion into Africa. “Our solutions allow business customers to bridge the financing hurdle and reduce dependence on an unstable power grid, greatly improving up-time and productivity,” says Solarise Africa co-founder and East Africa MD Patrik Huber. “By partnering with Solarise, we are offering both battery energy storage and solar projects to commercial and industrial facilities. These projects are fully financed with turnkey engineering and asset management services. Centennial’s projects are designed to improve our customers’ profitability, stabilise their power supply and support their commitments to achieving sustainability goals," adds Centennial founder and MD David John Frenkil.
