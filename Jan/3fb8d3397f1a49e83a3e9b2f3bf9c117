The water levels of the dams within the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) are at steady levels this week as persistent wet weather conditions replenish the system. The average water level of the system, which comprises 14 dams, is at 78.1% this week, an increase from 76.6% last week and 64.5% at the same time in the preceding year. The water levels of the Vaal dam increased from 74.5% last week and 56.2% during the same period last year to 75% this week, while the Sterkfontein dam recorded a rise in its water levels from 96.2% last week to 96.4% this week, exceeding the 91.7% it recorded last year at the same time. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) also reported an increase at the Bloemhof dam, which is currently at 109.6% after water levels rose from 78.3% last year and 108% last week. However, the water levels of the Grootdraai dam decreased marginally from 101.6% last week and 103% last year to the current 100.8%. Further, while the water levels of the Mohale dam, in Lesotho, remainÂ at low levels of 27.4%, it is higher than the 12.1% reported during the same period last year and 18.4% last week. Katse dam, also in Lesotho, saw an improvement in water levels, rising from 54% last week and 26.4% in the same period last year, to 56% this week. Despite the increase in the water levels, the DWS urges consumers to use water wisely and sparingly and recycle the scarce resource for use in homes.
