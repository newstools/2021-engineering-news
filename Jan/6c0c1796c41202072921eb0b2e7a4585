The US will ban entry to most non-US citizens who have recently been in South Africa in response to the new Covid-19 strain there, according to a White House official familiar with the plan. It’s unclear how long the restrictions will continue. The Biden administration will also continue restrictions on travel to the US from Brazil, the UK, Ireland and 26 countries in Europe that the Trump administration planned to relax as of Monday, said the official, who requested anonymity because the plans haven’t been made public. That’s consistent with comments from White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who tweeted on January 18 that “this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel.” The US is warily viewing new coronavirus strains that have originated in South Africa and Brazil, as well as one recently identified in the UK. Reuters first reported the US plan to ban travel from South Africa for most non-US citizens, citing officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
