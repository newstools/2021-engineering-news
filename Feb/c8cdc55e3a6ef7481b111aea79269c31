The Department of Transport (DoT) has announced new toll tariffs for South Africa’s national roads following Minister Fikile Mbalula’s approval and recommendation by the South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral). The adjustments are done yearly, in line with the consumer price index (CPI) as obtained from Statistics South Africa, with the latest having been gazetted on February 11 and coming into effect as of March 1. The CPI percentage that was applied to determine the tariff adjustment is 5%. Sanral communications GM Vusi Mona says the agency uses the inflation rate as a guide so that the toll tariffs “remain the same in real terms”. He says this translates into “effectively no increase to the rate from when the initial toll tariff was implemented.” Thirteen per cent of South Africa’s 22 253 km road network constitutes toll roads. Meanwhile, Sanral says discounts offered at specific toll plazas for frequent users, as well as qualifying local users still apply. Application for discounts can be made at the various toll plaza offices nationwide. Through Sanral, the DoT uses tolling selectively to implement major road infrastructure projects and ensure “seamless” mobility of vehicles on the national road network. Sanral explains that toll roads enable for the borrowing of capital to develop road infrastructure when it is required, rather than having to wait until funds are available from the fiscus. Toll monies are applied to maintain, operate and improve toll roads, as well as to service debt incurred to implement a toll road project. The agency also says that the cost in the event of delayed maintenance on roads can be up to 18 times higher than it would have been had routine preventive maintenance been undertaken.
