Automotive manufacturer Nissan Motor has set the goal to achieve carbon neutrality across the company’s operations and the life cycle of its products by 2050. As part of this effort, by the early 2030s, every all-new Nissan vehicle offering in key markets will be electrified, the company says. The manufacturer says it will pursue further innovations in electrification and manufacturing technology to make progress on the company’s carbon neutrality goal in several strategic areas. This includes battery innovations including solid-state and related technologies to develop cost-competitive and more efficient electric vehicles; the further development of Nissan’s e-POWER electrified powertrains to achieve greater energy efficiency; and the development of a battery ecosystem to support decentralised, on-site power generation for buildings with renewable energy sources. Moreover, Nissan anticipates increased collaboration with the energy sector to support the decarbonisation of power grids. It will also undertake manufacturing process innovations to support higher productivity in vehicle assembly, starting with the Nissan Intelligent Factory initiative. The company says it will also strive for greater energy and material efficiencies to support longer-term carbon neutrality ambitions. “We’re determined to help create a carbon neutral society and accelerate the global effort against climate change. "Our offering in electrified vehicles will continue to expand around the world, and this will make a major contribution to Nissan becoming carbon neutral. We will continue to drive innovation that enriches people’s lives as we pursue a sustainable future for all,” says Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida.
