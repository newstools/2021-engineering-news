The Hyundai Motor Group has introduced HTWO as a new brand to represent the group’s hydrogen fuel-cell system. The South Korean car maker says the brand builds on its 20-year-plus experience in hydrogen fuel-cell technology and will aim to present hydrogen as “a positive energy for humanity”. The goal is also to assist in establishing Hyundai’s global fuel-cell business and grow the hydrogen ecosystem. HTWO stands for H2, the hydrogen molecule, while also representing hydrogen and humanity. With HTWO, the Hyundai Motor Group says it is stepping up efforts for the development of a next-generation hydrogen fuel-cell system that can be applied to various forms of mobility, such as urban air transport, automobiles, vessels and trains. Hyundai says its next-generation fuel-cell system is available for many different mobility products and services. “It will deliver enhanced performance and durability at an affordable price in a lighter architecture with enhanced energy density. With its next generation fuel-cell system, the group aims to offer a highly efficient and diversified line-up of hydrogen-powered vehicles.” Through strategic partnerships with hydrogen, energy and logistics companies around the world Hyundai Motor Group has expanded its fuel-cell system business, with an initial focus on Korea, the US, Europe and China. Since marketing the world’s first mass-produced fuel-cell electric vehicle, the ix35, in 2013, the group has been expanding its range of vehicles powered by its fuel-cell system, adding models such as the Hyundai NEXO sports-utility vehicle, the XCIENT heavy-duty truck and a fuel-cell electric bus.
