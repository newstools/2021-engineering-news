The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has postponed the announcement of the spectrum Invitation to Apply (ITA) bidders until March 23. The authority initially planned to announce the qualified bidders of the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) ITA on February 22. Icasa opened the ITAs for the IMT and the Wireless Open Access Network on October 2. The auction phase, comprising the bidder seminar, the mock auction and the actual auction, besides others will start on March 31. “One of the critical milestones in this regard is the conclusion of a contract with the external and independent Auctioneer who will be overseeing and managing the entire auction process,” said Icasa chairperson Dr Keabetswe Modimoeng. “The conclusion of a contract and appointment of the service provider for the auction remains a key factor, and we remain confident that we are not off the track but in a better position to complete the licensing of high demand spectrum.”
