As was widely anticipated, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni refrained from announcing any new tax measures in his 2021 Budget, citing the need to support the pandemic-afflicted economy’s recovery. In addition, he announced a surprise withdrawal of previously announced hikes worth R40-billion, which had been signalled in the 2020 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS). In October, Mboweni indicated that there would be tax increases of R5-billion in 2021/22, R10-billion in 2022/23, R10-billion in 2023/24 and R15-billion in 2024/25. The decision to hold back on new taxes was made following a R99.6-billion upward adjustment, to R1.36-trillion, to the tax revenue estimate for 2020/21 when compared with the MTBPS projection. Collections were still expected to fall R213.2-billion short of the revenue forecast made in the 2020 Budget estimate, which predated the entry of Covid-19 into South Africa. The National Treasury also cited research showing that tax increases had a larger negative effect on growth than spending reductions and that these effects were more pronounced during a downturn. “Given the smaller revenue shortfall compared with October 2020 estimates, the previously announced tax increases of R40-billion have been withdrawn to support the economy,” the 2021 Budget Review document stated. The consolidated Budget Revenue for 2021/22 was forecast to be R1.52-trillion against expenditure of R2.02-trillion. The main tax adjustments announced in the Budget included: an increase in personal income tax brackets and rebates above the inflation rate of 4%; an 8% increase in excise duties on alcohol and tobacco; inflation-related increases of 15c/litre and 11c/litre for the general fuel levy and the Road Accident Fund levy respectively, with effect from April 7; and the resetting of the Unemployment Insurance Fund contribution ceiling at R17 711.58 a month from March 1. 14% BUDGET DEFICIT
The consolidated Budget deficit, meanwhile, had widened from 5.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019/20 to an estimated 14% in 2020/21, an improvement on the 15.7% deficit forecast in October. Better-than-projected revenue growth had provided government with space to narrow the consolidated Budget deficit more rapidly than projected in October 2020, however, from the 14% level this year to 6.3% of GDP in 2023/24. Gross debt was also projected to stabilise at a lower, yet still elevated, level of 88.9% of GDP in 2025/26, rather than the 95.3% forecast in October. Prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the National Treasury had forecast that government’s gross debt would peak at 65.6%. Gross loan debt was still expected to increase from R3.95-trillion, or 80.3% of GDP, in 2020/21 to R5.23-trillion, or 87.3% of GDP, by 2023/24. Debt-service costs would rise from R232.9-billion in 2020/21 to R338.6-billion in 2023/24. “These costs, which were already the fastest-rising item of spending, now consume 19.2% of tax revenue.” Mboweni argued that government’s fiscal strategy put South Africa on course to achieve a sufficiently large primary surplus, whereby total revenue will exceed noninterest expenditure, to stabilise debt. Under the path outlined, government’s main Budget noninterest expenditure would be reduced by R264.9-billion, or 4.6% of GDP, over the coming three-year period. Controversially, given the strength of public-sector unions, most of these adjustments were wage-bill-related, with the fiscal framework assuming a reduction in the growth in the wage bill and the share of spending on wages, while sustaining real spending increases on capital payments. The Budget Review noted that public-service compensation absorbed 41% of government revenues in 2019/20 and 47% in 2020/21 and described any continued rise as unsustainable. The 2021 Budget proposes a significant moderation in spending on the consolidated wage bill, growing by an average of 1.2% over the medium term. “The fiscal framework assumes compensation budget ceilings are maintained. A departure from this assumption in the forthcoming wage agreement will be unaffordable and compromise debt stabilisation,” the document added, while highlighting it as a key risk to the fiscal framework outlined in the Budget. The National Treasury warned that a three-year inflation-linked agreement would result in a total shortfall of R112.9-billion by 2023/24, while an agreement similar to the one achieved in 2018 – one percentage point higher than inflation – would create a compensation shortfall of R132.7-billion by 2023/24. Compensation of government employees was forecast at R623.8-billion for 2020/21, rising to R637-billion in 2021/22. A new round of public-service wage negotiations was scheduled to take place in the Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council during 2021. “Government’s chosen fiscal path is not easy, but it will support higher levels of economic growth and enable the country to avoid a debilitating debt spiral,” Mboweni argued.
