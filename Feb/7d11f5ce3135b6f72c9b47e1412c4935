Technology group Wärtsilä South Africa has achieved a Level 4 broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) rating. The company has been operating in South Africa since 1994 and has a good record in Africa, having supplied more than 7 000 MW of power plants across the continent. As part of its transformation strategy, Wärtsilä has established an Engineering Studies Ownership Trust to be its black shareholder to support education in South Africa. As part of the BBBEE Act and its Codes of Good Practice, together with the requirements set out for the Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme, the company has also increased its ability to procure goods and services from South African suppliers and subcontractors. “The Level 4 certification demonstrates our commitment not only to operational excellence but to remain an active and enthusiastic contributor to the future of the South African economy. “Our partnerships and cooperation with the likes of Nelson Mandela University that date back to 2014 show that, as a company, we are deeply invested in the development of our people and communities,” says Wärtsilä Energy Africa and Europe strategy and growth projects GM Tord Johnsson. Wärtsilä South Africa MD Feroza Cassim adds that, to create meaningful transformation, the company found that establishing an Engineering Studies Ownership Trust as its black shareholder would be an opportunity to further stimulate and encourage engineering studies for the benefit of the industry and Wärtsilä South Africa as a company.
