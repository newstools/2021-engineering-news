Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) chairperson Leonard Ramatlakane welcomed rail commuters upon the resumption of service on the Cape Town to Langa line on February 15. Ramatlakane reiterated that PRASA owed it to communities to reintroduce a reliable, safe and affordable public transport option during Covid-19 and difficult economic times. Moreover, the board and officials from PRASA said it had issued illegal shack dwellers in the Siyahlala informal settlement with a notice to vacate the track of the Cape Town Central line to enable PRASA to repair the rail line and resume the train service.
