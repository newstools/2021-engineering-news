The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) is taking steps to improve the performance of the asphalt plant it launched in 2018. The agency notes that the plant has been experiencing operational challenges in terms of human resources, supply of materials and challenges related to procurement to sustain operations. To address the issues, it has started a process to procure a technical adviser or specialist in asphalt plant operation. "Among other critical actions, the specialist will assist with a detailed diagnosis of the plant's operational issues and the overall running of the plant. This will reduce the risk for technical breakdowns. "For additional capacity at the plant, key appointments will be effected at critical management levels," the agency states. Further, suppliers for the input materials, namely aggregates and gas, have been appointed and the orders for the materials are in progress. The JRA is also in the process of securing a contract for total maintenance services. In addition, the agency will implement a training schedule for the current personnel at the plant covering some important aspects of operating the plant. "The training will ensure that the necessary skills are retained for continuous efficiency and the overall improvement of the plant’s operations," it says. In the meantime, the JRA has sourced asphalt from private suppliers, as well the assistance of contractors to augment the workforce to fast-track service delivery. This has resulted in 95 095 potholes being repaired across the City of Johannesburg’s seven regions between November 2020 and January.
