To bring about much-needed relief on roads and move goods more efficiently to the ports, Transnet’s Cape Town Container Terminal has piloted an inland operation that will see the haulage of reefer containers from Belcon Inland Terminal, in Bellville, to the port. The collaboration between Transnet’s two operating divisions – Port Terminals and Freight Rail – supports the State-owned entity’s strategy for a modal shift from road to rail, while effecting improvements in the entire supply chain. Through the pilot project with one of Transnet’s customers, 20 containers were hauled on February 5, with the aim to gradually increase this number, as more uptake from reefer container customers and cargo owners starts to occur. The Belcon Inland Terminal, from where reefer containers will be loaded and hauled to the terminal, is located about 20 km from Cape Town. Unlike a truck, which carries one reefer container per trip, one train has the capacity to carry up to 36 containers at a time. The inland operation is one of the projects that was earmarked for implementation as a response to both community and customer concerns over traffic in the vicinity. Transnet will continue to work with customers and other stakeholders in improving efficiencies in the system, and supporting the reliable delivery of freight.
