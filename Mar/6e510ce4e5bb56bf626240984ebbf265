South Africa's public sector unions want a general salary rise of consumer inflation plus 4% for all workers, according to a labour document presented on Monday, as talks began over a new wage deal. The list of 16 demands, which includes better housing payments and a risk allowance of 12% of basic salary because of the Covid-19 pandemic, comes amid heightened tension between unions representing over 1 million teachers, nurses and police and the state over salaries.
