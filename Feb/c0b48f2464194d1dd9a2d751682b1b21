Poland-focused real estate investment trust EPP has advised that the Polish government has allowed shopping centres to reopen on February 1. This follows after the country went into a three-week partial lockdown from December 28, with large shopping centres having remained restricted from trading. In turn, this followed Poland emerging from another lockdown on November 29, which also involved restricted trading for retail locations measuring more than 2 000 m2 in size. From February 1, 89% of EPP’s retail portfolio in terms of gross leasable area is able to operate again. However, restrictions remain applicable to restaurants – which can only operate on a takeaway and delivery basis, while cinemas, fitness and entertainment facilities remain closed. As of February 1, Poland has one of the lowest 14-day Covid-19 case notification rates per 100 000 inhabitants when compared to its neighbouring countries and the European Union.
