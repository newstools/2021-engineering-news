Power utility Eskom says it will implement load-shedding from 22:00 on February 9 to 05:00 on February 10 in orderÂ to preserve and replenish the emergency generation reserves and maximise the capacity available during the daytime hours. "The power generation system is still severely constrained due to high generation unit breakdowns during the past two days, as well as the delayed return to service of some units out on planned maintenance. "We currently have 4 858 MW on planned maintenance, while another 14 375 MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns and delays. Eskom expects some of these generation units to return to service from tomorrow, and will continuously assess the situation," it says.
