Electronics and technological solutions company Danfoss has changed its group structure to combine the heating and cooling segments into Danfoss Climate Solutions in an effort to intensify its focus on the “green agenda” in attractive global markets. The company notes that “everywhere in the world”, there is a strengthened focus on climate efforts and, by combining the heating and cooling segments into one business, Danfoss is investing in the future to help customers and partners take action to mitigate climate change and build a greener future. The company states that it holds significant positions within sustainable and energy efficient solutions for industry, the built environment and the entire food chain, and will leverage the climate agenda and the targets in the Paris Agreement and in the European Union Green Deal as strong driving forces in accelerating efforts. With the new Danfoss Climate Solutions segment, Danfoss will further strengthen its focus on innovation and application expertise to become an even stronger technology partner for customers and partners, the company states. Danfoss Climate Solutions president Jürgen Fischer says the products the company engineers and sells, play a part in the climate agenda and in meeting the world’s climate targets. “Buildings must be made energy-efficient and carbon emissions must be reduced. Governments and the private sector both have critical roles to play in making sure investment in sustainable energy innovation increases rather than declines at this pivotal moment.” He adds that Danfoss Climate Solutions already has the technologies and the solutions needed to support the transition to a decarbonised economy and, by working together, governments, companies, investors and citizens can better understand the challenges faced, and how to overcome them.
