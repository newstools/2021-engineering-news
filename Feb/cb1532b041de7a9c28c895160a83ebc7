The Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) looks set to reach the 100% mark as heavy downpours continue to fall throughout the country, with major dams within the system rapidly rising to full capacity, the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) said on February 10. "Being the biggest of the systems in the country, with 14 dams, the IVRS is at 89.4%. Last week, the system stood at 82% while, at the same time last year, it floated at 65.1%." The system is vitally important to Gauteng, and industries and large companies, such as State-owned power utility Eskom and petrochemicals multinational Sasol, are heavily dependent on it for their water supply. The Free State, North West and Mpumalanga are also supplied by the system, the DWS said. "The good fortunes brought by the persistent heavy showers have impacted positively on the Vaal dam, which is one of the critical dams in the system. For the first time in years, the dam sits at more than 100% capacity, at 101.5%. This shows a profound leap upwards from 79.8% during the first week of February. During the same comparable period last year, the dam was at 56.9%." With more showers forecast, the Vaal dam and other dams in the system could increase to even higher levels. The Sterkfontein dam, in the Free State, recorded a slight increase to 96.9% during the second week of February, up from 96.6% during the prior week. The dam was 92% during the same week last year. For the second consecutive week, the Grootdraai dam was floating at 108.4%, recording a marked improvement from 100.9% last year at the same time. The levels of the Bloemhof dam also climbed this week after it was the only dam that saw a fall within the system during the first week of February. Presently, it is at 103.1%, up from 102.0% the prior week. These levels are considerably higher when compared with the 76.8% at which it stood during the same period in 2020. Meanwhile, the stressed Mohale dam, in Lesotho, rose to 40.8% from 38.2% during the previous week and continues to increase weekly, but remains below the 50% mark. During the same time week last year, it was at 12.8%. The Katse dam, also in Lesotho, continues to see weekly increases and rose to 68.6% from 64.8% within a week. The dam is opening a wide gap between the current levels of 68.6% and those of 30% during the same period last year.
