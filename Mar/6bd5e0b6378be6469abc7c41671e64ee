Consumer goods company RCL Foods and US plant-based food company LIVEKINDLY Collective have established a local plant-based joint venture (JV) called LIVEKINDLY Collective Africa. This comes amid a growing consumer interest in plant-based foods and more sustainable living globally. The JV will market, sell and distribute all of LIVEKINDLY’s brands, including locally known Fry Family Food and international brands LikeMeat and Oumph! in sub-Saharan Africa. “Climate change, population growth, chronic hunger, obesity and a related rise in noncommunicable diseases mean that food producers need to find ways to feed people in a more sustainable way, which requires resilience and adaptability. “In line with our passion – More Food to More People, More Often – we are excited to partner with LIVEKINDLY Collective in taking plant-based protein from niche to mainstream in South and sub-Saharan Africa, which will provide people with more options and encourage more sustainable food choices,” says RCL CEO Miles Dally. LIVEKINDLY Collective Africa will bring together the collective’s cutting-edge brand and technology intellectual property and RCL’s farm to fork capability and established market presence to build a robust plant-based ecosystem in the region – from agriculture to go-to-market brands and infrastructure. While the plant-based food category is still relatively small in South Africa, both companies believe the significant progress being made in improving the affordability, taste and texture of plant-based alternatives will grow the category into a significant market in both traditional retail and foodservice channels.
