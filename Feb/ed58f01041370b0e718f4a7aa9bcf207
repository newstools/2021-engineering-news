Mercedes-Benz has lifted the veil on its new generation C-Class. Production of the model is set to start later this year – for the local and export markets – at the Mercedes-Benz South Africa (MBSA) plant, in East London, following a R10-billion investment by the German parent company. The investment included the construction of a new paint shop and body shop, an upgrade to the assembly plant and some new warehouses. The 2021 start of production of the new C-Class will mark the sixty-third anniversary of Mercedes-Benz production at the East London plant. The new C-Class will be produced in the Mercedes-Benz plants in Bremen (Germany), Beijing (China) and East London. Since the introduction of the current generation C-Class in 2014, more than 2.5-million models have been sold. China has been the largest sales market for the C-Class sedan since 2016, with the US, Germany and UK the largest sales markets for C-Class models in the last ten years.
