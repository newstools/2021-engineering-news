Emerging natural gas and helium producer Renergen has replaced its old transport truck with a new one, equipped with the diesel dual fuel (DDF) kit and tank from the former truck, in a bid to prove the equipment will “outlast the truck”. While the truck itself is not linked to the company’s recently announced cold-chain storage solution, the company uses the truck to transport gas to its customers. Renergen’s cold-chain solution requires liquefied natural gas (LNG) and will only be available later this year. However, citing new branding as “critical in any business”, Renergen CEO Stefano Marani says a company “needs to represent the pride every employee has for the company and our assets need to look the part”. Currently the first of hopefully many such trucks, the Renergen-branded vehicle is a Volvo 440 converted to run on DDF. “DDF is the responsible way forward. It reduces your carbon footprint, but also lowers running costs. Now that the technology is becoming more mainstream, the primary risk companies face is that by not adopting this technology, one runs the risk of becoming obsolete,” Marani tells Engineering News.
