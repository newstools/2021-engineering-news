The areas around the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) are experiencing heavy rains which are temporarily interrupting work on the sites, the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) reported on January 29. Heavy rainfall has been reported across most of the inland country which has impacted on the river flow levels and induced flooding in and around work areas within the LHWP. In the Polihali area, the floods have affected the diversion tunnels construction site, with the site evacuated to ensure the safety of all employees, none of whom have been injured. The full impact of the flooding will only be known when the flood waters have receded, however, the authority noted that the river had overtopped the temporary bridge, which allowed access to the construction site and the outlet and inlet portal berms, and there was some flooding in the tunnels and some equipment and temporary offices had washed away. “There will be temporary interruption to the works and operations will resume once the effects of the floods have been addressed. However, neither Phase II nor Phase I permanent infrastructure is threatened,” the LHDA assured. “The Phase I infrastructure is secure. Dam levels are rising which is to be expected, but there is no imminent danger of the dams spilling or the need to release water.” The water levels of the Mohale dam increased from 27.13% on January 27 to 34.09% on January 28, while the water levels of the Katse dam levels increased from 56.05% to 59.67% during the same period. “The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority advises the public to exercise care around the rivers and road cuttings. The ground is also saturated and may be unstable.” The LHDA said it is monitoring the situation and will provide updates as and when need arose.
