KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala on February 15 officially opened the R252-million Anton Lembede Mathematics, Sciences and Technology Academy, in Durban. The academy comprises 20 classrooms, one specialist classroom, a library, three computer laboratories and an administration block. It is able to accommodate 600 learners, with 150 learners having already enrolled for this year. Zikalala said the academy was an important building block in realising the vision of a KwaZulu-Natal that leads in science and technology, as well as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. "There can be no doubt that education is a powerful instrument not only for national development, but also for personal development," he added.
