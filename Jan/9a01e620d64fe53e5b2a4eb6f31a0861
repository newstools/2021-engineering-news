Power plant company Scatec has launched its new logo and profile, with this transformation following the company’s broadened growth strategy and the name change to Scatec from Scatec Solar. “2020 was a monumental year for Scatec. During the crisis, we made the greatest expansion since our establishment, by broadening our strategy and acquiring SN Power. I am, therefore, pleased to start the new year by unveiling a profile and logo supporting our ambition to become a global large-scale player in solar, hydro, wind and storage solutions, and an integrator of high-value infrastructure solutions,” says CEO Raymond Carlsen. In October, Scatec announced the acquisition of major hydropower player SN Power from Norfund. At the same time, the company announced its intention to change its name from Scatec Solar to Scatec to reflect a broader renewables company. The new name was adopted during an extraordinary general meeting in November 2020. “Scatec is a strong name, while the new logo represents a broader direction and increased pace, with units combined to symbolise people and technologies working together. The colours represent renewal, and the profile in its entirety is clear, bold and visually striking, with clear connotations to renewable energy,” Carlsen notes. The new logo and profile will be applied from January 5.
